I am a marine scientist exploring how hydrodynamics shape coral reefs. My current research centres around how flows on reefs affect biogeochemical variability, and how this variability affects the ability of coral reefs to cope with changing climate conditions. Away from work, you'll find me surfing or hiking in the Sierras.
